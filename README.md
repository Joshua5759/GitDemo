# Introduction 
In this report, I will be discussing how I created a lens for Snapchat by describing the development process of the project, the tools I used to make it as well as the challenges I faced during it and how I overcame them. 

# Development Process   

I started the development process on my AR app in ShapesXR and I began thinking of what I should do that could include the theme of Christmas in my project. I produced the idea that it should take place in an art gallery, as I thought it would be the best way to allow the viewer to interact with technology and because museums have adopted augmented reality to get viewers invested in the paintings. I named the room after Modest Mussorgsky’s famous piano suite, “Pictures at an Exhibition.”  

I first began creating the frames for each of the paintings and then I began work on each individual painting. I started working on a boat, which I changed to a cruise ship as I thought that would better represent the theme of the assignment. When thinking of what I could design that related to Christmas, I included a snowman, pine trees, Santa Claus and his reindeer, a house with a Christmas wreath and a car, as a subtle reference to Chris Rea’s “Driving Home for Christmas.” After I had finished the designs for all of them, I made a duplicate scene and edited the paintings to make it look like the events in the paintings are happening on Christmas Day by changing the shade of blue and making the events in each of them look different like the broom near the tree at night being held by the snowman in the day, the cruise ship sailing on waves in the night and appearing at daytime decorated with lights and red paint, or even by having Santa Claus with his reindeer at night and having the reindeer grazing near the igloo at day. 

After I finished completing the paintings, I exported them to Blender so that I would then import them into Lens Studio. First, I exported the two scenes into their own file and then I took all the paintings and put them in their own file. This was brief and was the part of the assignment that I found to not be challenging as it did not take a lot of time for me to complete it. 

After I finished, I went to Lens Studio to implement the effects that would be seen using a world mesh which would have the paintings appear on the viewer’s phone screen. I brought over all the paintings into Lens Studio and separated them into night scenes and day scenes. I turned the day scenes off so that when the viewer touched a painting, they would replace the paintings that were set in the night. 

# Tools  
The tools I used to design the paintings for my project were from the desktop editor on ShapesXR. I accomplished this by using the different 3D shapes to create a different painting for each frame. I found it to be quite easy and I had a lot of enjoyment working on the artwork as I was constantly thinking of what I should do with each painting and how I could make one that took place in the day look different when it was set during the night. 

Another tool that was utilised for my Snapchat Lens was Blender, which I used for transferring the various paintings I had into blend files so that it would be possible to export them into Lens Studio. As stated before, I did not spend a lot of time in Blender as I just needed to have the paintings in their own individual files so that it would be easier for me to export them into Lens Studio. 

When working on the lens in Lens Studio, I implemented a world mesh that would allow the paintings to appear on a phone after the Snapcode had been scanned. I added device tracking which would have the paintings remain in place on the viewer’s screen. My lecturer also inserted a script which would allow the two set of paintings to replace each other. This would allow the ones that are set in the night to disappear and have the day paintings take their place. 

# Challenges 
The challenges I faced were thinking of what each painting should be about as I wanted them all to be about Christmas in some form and I did not think about what each painting should contain in advance. I wanted there to be 6 paintings, and as a completed each one, I thought about what I should do for the other. However, as I continued to work on each painting, I had a clearer idea about what each should be about. 

Another challenge was using my VR headset to design the AR room as I found trying to get the precise look for how I wanted each painting to be more difficult than when I was using a desktop editor. The AR room was created on desktop, and I wanted to use the VR headset just to fix some of the paintings. However, I was not fully used to it, and I decided that I should just use the computers at college and my laptop at home as that was much easier as I had more control. 

My next challenge was to have my paintings transition from day to night using a button that the user could activate. I tried to implement a script that would allow the user to touch a painting, when the paintings were changed to the versions that took place in the day, they did not change back to the night versions. Though my lecturer could not find the exact code that would allow for that, I nonetheless achieved what I wanted from it. 

# Conclusion 
In conclusion, I managed the development process quite well as I achieved what I wanted from my project. I got what I envisioned for my Snapchat Lens using the tools from the 3 platforms I worked on, and I managed to overcome the various challenges I had to deal with. Overall, I felt that the development process for me went well as I understood how to use the tools that I acquired for my project, and I am pleased with how it turned out.
