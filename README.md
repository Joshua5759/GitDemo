## Introduction

In this report, I will be discussing how I created a lens for SnapChat by describing the development process of the project, the tools I used to make it as well as the challenges I faced during it and how I overcame them.  

## Development Process  

I started the development process on my AR app in ShapesXR and I began thinking of what I should do that could include the theme of Christmas in my project. I produced the idea that it should take place in an art gallery, as I thought it would be the best way to allow the viewer to interact with technology and because museums have adopted augmented reality to get viewers invested in the paintings. I named the room after Modest Mussorgsky’s famous piano suite, “Pictures at an Exhibition.” 

I first began creating the frames for each of the paintings and then I began work on each individual painting. After I had finished the designs for all of them, I made a duplicate scene and edited the paintings to make it look like the events in the paintings were happening in the day by changing the shade of blue and making the events in each of them look different like the broom near the tree at night being held by the snowman in the day, or the cruise ship sailing on waves and decorated with lights and red paint. 

The development process for me was quite easy and I found it to be quite simple for me to understand how to use the tools in ShapesXR. 

## Tools 

The tools I used to design the paintings for my project were from the desktop editor on ShapesXR. I accomplished this by using the different 3D shapes to create a different painting for each frame. I found it to be quite easy and I had a lot of enjoyment working on the artwork. 

After I finished completing the paintings, I exported them to Blender so that I would then import them into Lens Studio. First, I exported the two scenes into their own file and then I took all the paintings and put them in their own file. This was brief and it did not take a lot of time to complete. 

After I finished, I went to Lens Studio to implement the effects that would be seen using augmented reality to have them appear on the viewer’s phone screen. I brought over all the files. 

## Challenges

The challenges I faced were thinking of what each painting should be about as I wanted them all to be about Christmas in some form. I wanted there to be 6 paintings, and as a completed each one, I thought about what I should do for the other. However, as I continued to work on each painting, I had a cleared idea about what each should be. 

Another challenge was using my VR headset to design the AR room as I found trying to get the precise look for how I wanted each painting to be more difficult than when I was using a desktop editor. I decided that I should just use the computers at college and my laptop at home as that was much easier as I had more control. 

My next challenge was to have my paintings transition from day to night using a button that the user could activate. I tried to implement a script that would allow the user to touch a painting, when the paintings were changed to the versions that took place in the day, they did not change back to the night versions. Though my lecturer could not find the exact code that would allow for that, I nonetheless achieved what I wanted from it.
